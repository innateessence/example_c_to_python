# Python Module in pure C (Example)

## What is this

* C source code for defining a python module in C-land

## Why does this exist?

* Been wanting to do this for quite some time, feels good to finally do it
* I'll likely want to write some custom module in C for some odd use-case in the future, and python has been my primary lang for over a decade
* I've enjoyed the idea of writing C for a long time, the longer I program, the more appealing C becomes. but python is always so much more convenient. This gives me a good reference for achieving the best of both worlds.

## Compiling

* `python setup.py install`

## Testing / seeing it in action

* `python test.py`
